		<h3>Faux Feelings</h3>
		<p>
			Feelings are emotions or sensations, free of thought and story. These are to be distinguished from thoughts
			(e.g., "I feel I didn't get a fair deal") and from words colloquially used as feelings but which convey what
			we think we are (e.g., "inadequate"), how we think others are evaluating us (e.g., "unimportant"), or what
			we think others are doing to us (e.g., "misunderstood", "ignored"). -
			<i>from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			Thoughts disguised as feelings It's helpful to clearly distinguish between feelings and thoughts. Many of
			the words we use in everyday life that we think are expressing feelings, are actually thought. For example,
			if I say I'm feeling "abandoned", what I'm actually saying is that I think someone is abandoning me. There
			are lots of genuine (and painful!) feelings associated with that thought - maybe anger, sadness, fear,
			amongst others - but the word "abandoned" isn't itself a feeling. We call these "faux" feelings words - faux
			is French for "false", and it also sounds like "foe", meaning enemy, and that's exactly what these words
			give us - enemy images.
		</p>
		<p>
			They're thoughts about what other people are doing to us, and usually leave us feeling powerless and afraid.
			It helps to really unpack what we're feeling beneath those stories we're telling ourselves. I'm not saying
			the stories aren't true - just that we can be more resourced and resilient by focusing on the feeling (which
			we might be able to do something about) rather than the actions of others (which we have zero control over).
		</p>
		<p>
			Below is a list of words people tend to use as feelings, and some suggestions of the actual feelings that
			might be beneath them, as well as the precious needs that might be at play when we're using such words.
