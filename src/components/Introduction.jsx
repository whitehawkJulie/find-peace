			<strong>This is a 4-step “OFNR” process — Observation, Feelings, Needs, and Request.</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			Before you start… if you’ve come to use this tool, you’re probably wanting resolution to something. You
			might think you want answers, action, or change — but more often than not, the first thing we actually need
			is clarity and self-connection.
		</p>

		<p>
			This tool will help you identify the deep longings underneath what you’re feeling. And once you’ve made
			contact with those needs, you may find your whole body relaxing into relief, clarity, or even hope.
		</p>

		<p>
			From that place of connection, you’ll have more resilience and creativity — and a clearer sense of your next
			step.
		</p>

		<p>So take a breath. Slow down. Let yourself really feel into these questions. It’s worth the time.</p>

		<p>
			At the end, you’ll be offered the option to explore what might be going on for the other person involved (if
			there is one). I know — you might not care about that right now 🙂 — but it’s a powerful process. Trust me.
		</p>
		<p>
			This tool is based on the 4-step process of Nonviolent Communication (NVC) — Observation, Feelings, Needs,
			and Request (OFNR).
		</p>
		<p>
			You don’t need to know anything about NVC to use it. Each step includes helpful prompts and optional
			guidance. Take your time, and follow your body’s sense of resonance — it knows what’s true.
		</p>
		<p>
			You’ll begin by exploring what’s going on in <em>you</em> — and in the final step, you’ll have the option to
			consider what might be going on for someone else involved.
		</p>
		<p>
			Marshall Rosenberg, creator of NVC, used to say: <br />
			<em>"When we uncover the needs, the solutions find us."</em>
