			<p>EMPATHY: Ah, these particular words are so painful, aren't they?!</p>
			<p>
				WHY REFRAME? These <strong>"faux feeling"</strong> words that actually thoughts, but we often use them
				as feeling words. Part of why they so painful is they're actually thoughts (rather than specific
				body-based feelings) about what we think someone else is doing to us, as we're mostly utterly powerless
				over other people's behaviour. Don't get me wrong, there are absolutely big feelings underneath these
				words, but it's so much more useful to us if we can identify the actual feelings, rather than just the
				though. When we use these words, we often feel like victims, unable to change our experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				HOW TO REFRAME The good (or at least, better!) news is that we're NOT powerless over the stories we tell
				ourselves, and our actual feelings, which occur in our bodies. So let's unpack these particular words,
				so we can notice the judgments, diagnoses, or assumptions. This is an opportunity to (a) consider
				whether the story is actually true, and (b), unpack the actual feelings underneath. The body has a
				powerful ability to move through emotions, but the mind DOES NOT. It will dwell on them forever, given
				the opportunity! Add "message delivered" stuff here from Sarah Peyton.
			</p>
			<p>
				{" "}
				LET'S START So let‚Äôs unpack them, to see what might be going on underneath, so we see what parts we can
				actually do something about.
